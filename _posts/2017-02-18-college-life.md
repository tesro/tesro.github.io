College Life boasts to have one of the most sweet and cherishable memories of a persons lifetime

-----------------------------------------

<p>So yeah, one remembers the college life for like forever. We like to hold on to those lovely memories to the last breath. When all of us were heartbroken by the fact that we are done with school and we have left those beautiful days behind us, The College helped us to bear the grief but now when the college is nearly done, my heart trembles with fear because I see no one on the other side to help me cope up with this loss.</p>

<p>This College life teaches you so much, you make friends, enemies, memories and what not, then the time suddenly comes to bid farewell and you be like, "I am not yet done with you dude, you cant leave me right now, we have things to do and things to amend, things I always wanted to try". You realize there would be no more class bunking and those lip smacking foods from the canteens, those crushes, lovely parties and that carefree living in the present without worrying about the future and all.</p>

<p>You wonder what is life like on the other side (after college), whether it is fun and happening or is it the some monotonous work and no fun at all, I wont say about it right now, because it is too bad to make assumptions about future, but one thing I know for sure that is life wont be like this anymore and I am going to miss it.</p>
