Books are the best friends a person can have!

# You know youâ€™ve read a good book when you turn the last page and feel a little as if you have lost a friend.
# If we encounter a man of rare intellect, we should ask him what books he reads.

<p>So as you might be guessing that books do hold an important position in your life, Here are some of the books I have either read or have them on to read list, hope you also find them worth a read! </p>
